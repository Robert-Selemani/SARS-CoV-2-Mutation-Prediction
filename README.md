# SARS-CoV-2-Mutation-Prediction
Abstract 
Viral evolution poses a significant challenge in the design and development of 
effective vaccines. The rapid mutation of viruses often renders newly developed 
drugs ineffective by the time they reach patients. This is exemplified by the 
COVID-19 vaccines, which were based on the initial SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein 
sequence from the Alpha variant detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. 
As the virus evolves, these vaccines become less effective against new, often more 
infectious strains. This research aims to address this issue by enhancing the 
prediction of viral evolution to streamline vaccine development. The researchers 
utilised a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Artificial Neural Network to predict 
potential mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein sequences. By applying the 
algorithm to time-series data of the Spike Protein sequences, the trained model 
can forecast the sequences of future virus strains. These predicted sequences can 
inform drug research and design, enabling the development of effective vaccines 
against anticipated viral mutations, thereby accelerating the vaccine production 
process and improving public health responses to emerging viral threats and future 
pandemics.
